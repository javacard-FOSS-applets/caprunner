Overview
========

CAPRunner is a set of python library to parse and execute CAP
files. It also comes with an handy ``runcap.py`` that bind them
together and allow you to send some APDUs to a CAP file (without the
need for a smartcard).

Dependencies
============

In order to compile CAP files, you will need a working Java
Development Kit together with a JavaCard Development Kit.

This project also relies on the following other ones:

* pythoncard_ which provide the JavaCard OS functionnalities in
  Python.
* and (optionnaly) pythonplatform_ which provides a minimal set of
  functionnalities from the `globalplatform`_ World.

.. note:: You will only need ``pythonplatform`` if your applet relies
	  on some globalplatform functionnalities.

Installation
============

Your best chance for the moment is to clone the repository using
`Mercurial`_ to a local directory::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/benallard/caprunner/

This will create a copy of the repository in a ``caprunner``
directory.

In order to get the dependencies right, I suggest you also clone their
repositories (the second one is optionnal)::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/benallard/pythoncard/
    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/benallard/pythonplatform/

Finally, the easiest way to get the dependencies resolved is to *copy*
(or *link* on UNIX) the following directories at the root of the
``caprunner`` directory:

* ``python``, ``pythoncard`` and ``pythoncardx`` from the pythoncard
  directory
* and (optionnaly) ``org`` from the pythonplatform directory.

Getting started
===============

As a final step, you will need to *compile* the export files used
during compilation of your applet into a JSON file. This step is
needed in order to not read every single export file at each startup.

This is done with the following command line::

    $ genref.py --dump dump.json /path/to/export_files

This will generate a file called ``dump.json`` containing the
necessary information from the export files. The path given as second
parameter is the directory containing the export files from your
JavaCard Development Kit (e.g. the ``api21_export_files`` directory
for a JavaCard 2.1.2).

CAPRunner will expect the generated json file to be called 
``<JavaCard version>.json``

Finally, you should be able to launch ``runcap.py``. By default, it
will emulate a JavaCard Classic 3.0.1, if you need another version,
just give it as parameter. For instance::

    $ ./runcap.py 2.1.2

Starting from here, ``runcap`` will wait for your orders. Please refer
to the `documentation`_ for the format of the order to send to
``runcap``.

Contribution
============

* If an issue is bugging you, the `issue tracker`_ is your best friend
  to begin with.
* If you want to help me improve this project, write some more docs or
  add functionnalities, the best for you is to make yourself an
  account on `BitBucket`_, fork the `repository`_ and make a Pull
  request. Chances are big that I also accept patches per mail.
